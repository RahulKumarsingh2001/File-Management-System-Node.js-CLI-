# 🗂️ File Management System (Node.js CLI)

A simple **command-line file manager** built using Node.js.  
It allows users to manage files and folders directly from the terminal — including creating, writing, deleting, and listing items.  
This project demonstrates the use of Node.js core modules for file system and user input handling.
